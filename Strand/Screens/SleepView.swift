// MARK: - SleepView
//
// Whoop-sleep clarity on the locked Noop component system. Scannable in two seconds:
//   1. HERO ChartCard "Last night" — the stage breakdown (Hypnogram if intervals
//      reconstruct from stagesJSON, else a clean proportional stacked stage bar),
//      trailing = total asleep, footer = REM/Deep/Light/Awake each "Xh Ym · NN%".
//   2. A uniform grid of fixed StatTiles, each with a sparkline and a "vs typical"
//      caption: Performance, Efficiency, Consistency, Hours vs Needed, Restorative,
//      Respiratory, Sleep Debt.
//   2b. The sleep-debt LEDGER card — a rolling 14-night running balance of (slept −
//      personal need) with a plain-English read and a diverging per-night delta bar.
//   3. "Stages vs typical" NoopCard — Deep/REM/Light as horizontal bars, last-night
//      minutes with a marker at the personal typical (mean) so highs/lows pop.
//   4. A 30-day asleep-hours ChartCard trend.
//
// Every surface is a NoopCard / StatTile / ChartCard — no hand-sized cards, one grid,
// equal margins. Data wiring is preserved from the previous screen (stagesJSON =
// minutes for light/deep/rem/awake; typical = mean of repo.days).

// `@EnvironmentObject var live`, so a live tick re-renders only the mark card / syncing note — never
// the hero hypnogram, the stage chart, the metric grid or the trends. They render byte-for-byte what
// the inline code did before the extraction (mirrors the Today leaf-scoping pattern).

/// The "going to sleep / I'm awake" sleep-mark card (#461, Phase 1). Tapping logs a timestamped mark —
/// persisted to the `sleep_mark` metric series AND appended to the shareable strap log — then confirms
/// with a haptic and a transient line. LOGGING ONLY: a mark never touches the sleep detector or the
/// night boundaries. Owns `live` (it appends to the strap log) + `repo` (the metric-series write) and
/// the `lastMark` confirmation state, so its strap-log write keeps working without SleepView observing.
/// The "Sleep marks" tap-to-log card. Lives in the Sleep tab but is also hostable in Today
