// MARK: - Deep Timeline (full-day, full-resolution metric viewer) — #575
//
// The headline tap-through from Explore: a whole-day line for one metric that the user can ZOOM and PAN
// down to the raw per-second signal. The hard problem — never drawing ~86k points for a worn 24h — is
// solved in the read layer (`Repository.timelineSeries` picks coarse SQL buckets at day scale and raw
// seconds when zoomed in), so this screen only ever receives ~targetPoints points regardless of zoom.
//
// Reuses the existing `OverviewHRChart` (its `.chartXScale(domain:)` already pins the axis); the chart's
// zoom binding drives the visible window, and re-reads at the new resolution as the window changes. macOS
// adds scroll-to-zoom (no pinch); both platforms drag-to-pan. Serves #574 (owned-source filter / honest
// "Other sources" disclosure) and is the detail surface behind #582.
//
// #979 spin-offs: (1) annotation parity with the classic Today whole-day chart — the main night's sleep
// band + a sport glyph at each workout, fed through the SAME OverviewHRChart layers Today uses (this
// screen previously drew a bare line, despite being sold as "the whole-day trend with bands"); (2) an
// iPhone touch-and-hold scrub (`touchScrub: true`) so the crosshair readout the Mac pointer hover gets
// is reachable on touch too.
