// MARK: - Control Center (the home dashboard), HomeDensity rewrite

// The owner's complaint was "cards then random space". This rebuild is a tight,
// GAPLESS dashboard grid: one column of uniform sections, every gap == NoopMetrics.gap,
// every section break == NoopMetrics.sectionGap, equal margins from ScreenScaffold.
//
// Composition (top → bottom):
//   (a) HERO, full-width HStack that fills the width EQUALLY: RecoveryRing (left card)
//               + InsightCard "Today's Synthesis" (right card). No lone card, no gap.
//   (b) METRICS, one adaptive LazyVGrid of fixed-104pt StatTiles (Recovery, Strain,
//               Sleep, HRV, RHR, SpO2, Respiratory, Steps, Weight, Calories) each with
//               a 14-day sparkline so the grid tiles perfectly with no empty cells.
//   (c) LAST WORKOUTS, the SAME adaptive grid of fixed-104pt workout StatTiles.
//   (d) DATA SOURCES, one full-width NoopCard footer of SourceBadges + counts.
//
// Sparse series (weight) fall back to ALL history so a tile never shows an empty
// state when data exists. Only locked StrandDesign components are used.

/// SourceBadge + ScoreStatePill block), the column's intrinsic height climbed past 150 and the fixed frame
/// CLIPPED it, so the badge under the Rest ring overlapped the content below (the reported overlap glitch).

    // the reported jank. Instead the handful of regions that actually show live values (the top-bar
    // recording light, the "syncing history" note, the strap battery + sync rows) are extracted into small
    // leaf subviews that each own their OWN `@EnvironmentObject live`, so a 1 Hz tick only re-renders those

    // EXPENSIVE recomputes; this removes the cheap-but-constant view-tree re-evaluation flood on top.

    // #755 FIX-3 (DEFERRED, note only, not done): a `repo.refreshSeq` bump still re-evaluates the WHOLE
    // Today `body` (TodayView observes `repo` via @EnvironmentObject, and every section reads it). #755's
    // fixes 1+2 cut the bump FREQUENCY hard (a multi-chunk backfill now coalesces to a handful of refreshes,

    // longer a STORM, that was the scroll-stutter root cause and it is addressed. A true fix-3 (stop a

    // heartRateTrendSection, the Key-Metrics grid, yourCardsSection, workoutsSection, sourcesSection, into
    // its own leaf view that reads ONLY the @State snapshot loadAll commits (sparks / restScore / hrPoints /
