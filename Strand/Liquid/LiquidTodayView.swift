//  LiquidTodayView.swift
//  NOOP · Liquid design language — the Today screen, rebuilt in the liquid finish.
//
//  This is the FULL Today, re-created faithfully from the locked mockup
//  (scratchpad/liquid-metal-home.html): sky title + record/add/battery controls,
//  the three scores as liquid vessels with a card-level source badge, the live heart-rate
//  thread, the five "your cards" as liquid chips, a greeting + readiness pills,
//  Synthesis, Recovery Vitals, a Key Metrics grid (incl. steps), Last Workouts
//  and Data Sources. Every value binds to the SAME real data the classic
//  TodayView reads (accessors verified against TodayView.swift), and every tap
//  routes to the same public destination. The sky is a fixed, full-bleed
//  background (edge-to-edge under the status bar, does not scroll).
