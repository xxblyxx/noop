/// (WidgetAnchorTest.kt) so the two platforms stay byte-for-byte in agreement: anchor on today's row when
/// scored, else carry the freshest STRICTLY-PRIOR scored day, with the #304 pre-04:00 carve-out and the
/// #547 future-day guard folded in.

/// (Effort, Rest, HRV, Resting HR) are resolved per-field by `Repository.glanceFields` and are
/// unaffected by a nil here — see `WidgetGlanceFieldsTests`. A nil anchor used to blank all five,
/// which is the bug that resolver exists to fix.
