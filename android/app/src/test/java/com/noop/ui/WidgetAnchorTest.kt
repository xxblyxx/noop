/**
 * #911: the SHARED anchor selector both widget producers (the in-app republish in AppViewModel AND the
 * background-service producer in WhoopConnectionService) resolve the widget's day through, so the two
 * can never drift apart around the rollover. Pins the SAME selection the iOS [WidgetAnchorTests] asserts
 * (Swift Repository.widgetAnchor) so the two platforms stay byte-for-byte in agreement: anchor on today's
 * row when scored, else carry the freshest STRICTLY-PRIOR scored day, with the #304 pre-04:00 carve-out
 * and the #547 future-day guard folded in.
 *
 * NOTE what a null anchor does and does NOT mean: it gates RECOVERY only. Rest and Effort resolve off
 * today's own row and are unaffected — see [WidgetGlanceFieldsTest]. A null anchor used to blank all
 * three, which is the bug that split fixed.
