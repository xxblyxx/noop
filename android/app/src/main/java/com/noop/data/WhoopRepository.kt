 * high. `seq` counts occurrences of each EQUAL (ts, rrMs) beat (0, 1, …), so both survive.
 *
 * Keying by (ts, rrMs) — not ts alone — is deliberate: DISTINCT intervals keep seq 0 and thus their own
 * (deviceId, ts, rrMs, 0) key, so a distinct beat is NEVER dropped even when same-second beats arrive in
 * SEPARATE insert batches or via the live/historical merge (an earlier ts-only index would have restarted

 * the same (ts, rrMs, seq) → the insert stays idempotent. The residual: two EQUAL beats in one second that
 * straddle a live-flush boundary still collide (batch-local), the same narrow case the old key dropped and
 * strictly no worse; the authoritative historical path delivers a second's beats atomically in one batch.
 * Pure so it is unit-testable.
 *
 * Also stamps `ord` (Room v24, #823): the beat's position among ALL beats sharing this `ts` in this batch —
 * its emission order, which `seq` cannot express because `seq` keys on (ts, rrMs) and so is 0 for every
 * DISTINCT beat in a second. `ord` is NOT in the key and never affects which rows survive; it exists so
 * reads can return beats in the order the heart produced them rather than sorted by value, which biases
 * RMSSD down. Same batch-local caveat as `seq`: a second split across two live flushes restarts `ord` at 0,
 * and ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING keeps whichever row landed first. The historical path delivers a second
 * atomically, so the authoritative copy is correctly ordered.

     *
     * WHY THIS EXISTS. Two paths write R-R for the same wall-second: the live stream, as beats arrive, and
     * the offload, when the strap's own record of those same seconds is downloaded later. The two disagree
     * by a few milliseconds, so `ON CONFLICT … IGNORE` cannot collapse them and BOTH survive — the same
     * heartbeats stored twice. Measured on a WHOOP 5.0 over a 6.3 h window: 14,193 rows stored against the
     * strap's own claim of 8,608 (1.65x), and per second 2.105 s of beat-time where two batches wrote
     * versus 1.079 s where one did. The excess tracked the BLE connection exactly — zero duplication
     * across a 2 h 18 m disconnect, resuming in the same minute the phone reconnected.
     *
     * So a historical batch CLEARS each second it carries beats for before writing its own. Still
     * idempotent: re-offloading a chunk deletes and rewrites the same values. A second this batch carries
     * NO beats for is deliberately left alone. Twin of Swift `WhoopStore.insertHistorical`.
