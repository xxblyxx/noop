     *  offload (a v26 WHOOP 5 night with no measured HR) still advances the frontier, matching the
     *  Swift reader (Reads.swift latestHrSampleTs). Both persist on the same per-second ts grid.

     *  seek the last matching index entry; wrapping the columns in a compound subquery first makes the

     *  746 MB store (3.1M hrSample rows) at 4.3–5.8 s for the old shape and 0.01–0.07 s for this one
     *  (#908); Room is SQLite, so the same plan applies here, and this reader is on paths a user waits
     *  on — FullDayChartScreen's land-on-the-latest-day effect and DataSourcesScreen's load.
     *
     *  Identical answer in every case: each scalar subquery is NULL when that stream has no rows for the
     *  device, MAX() ignores NULLs, and both-empty stays NULL. Both arms are aliased because Room
     *  verifies queries at compile time and only the first arm's names survive a compound select. */
