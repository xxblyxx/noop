 *
 *  - [connected]   GATT connection is up (CBPeripheral didConnect)
 *  - [bonded]      one confirmed write to the command char has been ACKed (the WHOOP "bond")
 *  - [heartRate]   most-recent plausible BPM (30..220) from the standard 0x2A37 profile OR the
 *                  custom REALTIME_DATA frame
 *  - [rr]          most-recent R-R intervals (ms); the standard profile is the reliable source
 *  - [batteryPct]  battery percent — 5/MG: 0x2A19 whole %; WHOOP 4: GET_BATTERY_LEVEL response u16/10
 *                  (the 4.0's 0x2A19 is a stub constant 100 and is ignored, #77)
 *  - [worn]        wrist-wear from WRIST_ON/WRIST_OFF events; defaults true (Swift parity) so
 *                  wear-gated features work before the first event lands

 *   2. onScanResult — stop scan, `connectGatt` (centralManager didDiscover → central.connect).
 *   3. onConnectionStateChange(CONNECTED) — request MTU, allow the GATT operation to settle, then
 *      `discoverServices` (didConnect → discoverServices).
 *   4. onServicesDiscovered — for the custom service: capture the cmd-write char and fire THE BOND
 *      (one confirmed write of GET_BATTERY_LEVEL); subscribe to the three custom notify chars + the
 *      standard HR and battery chars (didDiscoverCharacteristicsFor).
 *   5. onCharacteristicWrite — the confirmed-write ACK == bonding succeeded; run the connect
 *      handshake EXACTLY ONCE (didWriteValueFor + connectHandshakeDone guard).
 *   6. onCharacteristicChanged — route inbound bytes (didUpdateValueFor):
 *        • HR char (0x2A37)      → parse standard HR + R-R
 *        • battery char (0x2A19) → first byte = percent

 *   - The caller MUST hold BLUETOOTH_SCAN and BLUETOOTH_CONNECT at runtime before [connect].
 *   - On API <= 30, BLUETOOTH + BLUETOOTH_ADMIN are install-time, but a coarse/fine LOCATION
 *     runtime permission is required for BLE *scanning* to return results.
 *   - Declaring `android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation"` on BLUETOOTH_SCAN lets you skip
 *     the location grant on API 31+ (we filter by service UUID, never deriving location).
 *   - Every android.bluetooth call below is annotated @SuppressLint("MissingPermission"); the

         * Yes exactly when a frame is held for retry and the completion is for a command-channel write. A
         * completion for a frame the stack claimed to refuse proves the refusal was wrong and the frame went
         * out, so repeating it delivers the same command to the strap twice — the reported symptom, where one
         * GET_DATA_RANGE drew three responses carrying one unchanged origin-seq echo.
         *
         * `pendingRetry` is non-null only when the most recent DRAINED write returned BUSY, and the drain
         * never starts a write while one is in flight — so within the drain there is no other outstanding
         * command-channel write this completion could belong to. A frame the stack truly refused produces no
         * completion at all, leaving its retry to fire, so the #77/#312 protection against a silently dropped
         * TOGGLE_REALTIME_HR / SET_CLOCK / offload-ack is untouched.
         *
         * [writeBondFrame] is the exception that forces the third argument: it writes to the same
         * characteristic DELIBERATELY outside the queue, so its completion is not evidence about the held
         * frame. Acting on it would cancel a retry for a frame that never went out — turning the duplicate
         * this fixes into the silent loss #77/#312 is about, which is strictly worse. Excluded explicitly.
         *
         * Only WITH-response writes reach here at all: a without-response write gets no completion callback
         * (the drain frees its own slot after a pacing gap), so this cannot help those. That happens to cover
         * the reported case and the commands where a duplicate actually harms — GET_DATA_RANGE, SET_CLOCK,
         * the historical acks, haptics and RUN_ALARM are all sent with response — but it is a real limit, not
         * a general guarantee.

     * EXPERIMENTAL R22 telemetry (#174) — port of macOS BLEManager.noteWhoop5R22Telemetry.
     * (1) A COMMAND_RESPONSE (type 0x24) to a SET_CONFIG (0x78) = the strap ACKing one enable_r22 flag.
     * (2) A type-0x2F record OUTSIDE our own history offload is NOT a separate live stream. #494 showed
     *     these are historical-offload data: they appear when a SECOND BLE client pulls the strap's
     *     history (SendHistoricalData) — the burst scales with the disconnect/backlog time, not
     *     wall-clock — and the SET_CONFIG enable_r22_* sequence (accepted 15/15) starts no separate
     *     stream. type-0x2F is only ever the historical offload (confirmed across #344's v20/v21 captures
     *     too). We still surface these as a diagnostic, but as what they are — another client's backlog
     *     reaching us over the shared notify channel — not a live R22 "unlock".
     * 5/MG puffin layout: packet_type @ byte 8, the responded-to cmd @ byte 10.
     *
     * #174 cooldown: when our own offload ENDS, the strap can keep flushing a few trailing type-0x2F
     * records AFTER `backfilling` has already flipped false. So we stamp [lastOffloadFrameAtMs] on every
     * offload frame (and at HISTORY_COMPLETE) and skip a non-offload 0x2F within
     * [DEEP_PACKET_LIVE_COOLDOWN_MS] of it. The flag-ACK counting (1) is unchanged.

     * (an unchecked `RuntimeException`) — which the GATT layer never declared, so nothing caught it

     * `SecurityException` (permission revoked) from the same calls. On ANY of these the link is gone:
     * tear down so the UI flips to disconnected instead of crashing.
     *
     * @return the block's boolean (stack-accepted) on success, or `false` if the binder was dead — a
     *   `false` lets callers run their normal "rejected by stack" path, which after teardown is inert
