/// #1169: an alternative headline resting-HR definition — the arithmetic MEAN of valid HR samples in the
/// LONGEST (primary) sleep session, rather than the lowest-per-session floor `AnalyticsEngine` ships today.
///
/// ## Why (issue #1169, artemc)
/// The shipped daily RHR is `restingHRDaily = matched…restingHR.min()` (`AnalyticsEngine`) — a nightly HR
/// FLOOR, and the `.min()` lets a short low-HR nap replace the main overnight session. A clean-room,
/// single-participant 5-night experiment (official WHOOP RHR + a Polar H10 ECG mean as independent
/// references, a pre-declared dev/holdout split, no fitted offset) found the primary-session sample mean
/// tracked both references far better: rounded MAE vs the official target 6.0→2.0 (dev) / 7.5→0.8 (holdout).
///
/// ## Deliberately PURE and UNWIRED
/// This computes the metric and is unit-tested, but **nothing consumes it yet**. The shipped headline AND the
/// recovery / strain / workout-detection / energy inputs all read `restingHRDaily` (the floor) in
/// `AnalyticsEngine`, so switching them is a re-baselining of core scores — which the issue itself says needs
/// a larger multi-participant, pre-declared holdout first. That is out of scope here; this lands the
/// transparent, testable definition so that validation and any later wiring have something concrete to use.
///
/// ## Definition (documented per the issue)
/// - **Primary session**: the LONGEST session by duration; ties resolve to the FIRST (stable). A shorter nap
///   never replaces the main night — this is the half the shipped `.min()` gets wrong.
/// - **Valid sample**: bpm within `validBpm` (default 30…220, matching `AnalyticsEngine`'s worn-HR range).
///   Anything outside the range — or a missing sample (simply absent from the array) — is excluded.
/// - **Mean**: the arithmetic SAMPLE mean (unweighted). The experiment validated the sample mean; a
///   time-weighted variant behaves differently under irregular cadence and must be evaluated separately.
/// - **Coverage**: returns `nil` unless the primary session has at least `minValidSamples` valid samples.
/// - The result is an APPROXIMATION, not a clinically validated measurement.
///
