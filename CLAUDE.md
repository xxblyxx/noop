# CLAUDE.md — working on NOOP

## ⛔ THIS FORK IS PRIVATE — NEVER CONTACT UPSTREAM. HIGHEST PRIORITY RULE.

**Nothing from this tree ever leaves it.** This fork's work stays local to the maintainer. No
exceptions, no "just this once", and no asking whether an exception applies.

Specifically forbidden, whether or not it looks helpful:
- **No pull requests** to `ryanbr/noop` or any other upstream/remote repo.
- **No issue comments, replies, reactions, or new issues** upstream — including posting a
  measurement, a correction, a census line, or a capture, however clearly it would help.
- **No `gh` (or `git push`, `curl`, API) command that writes to any repo other than
  `xxblyxx/noop`.** Reading upstream is fine; writing is not.
- **No sending findings anywhere off this machine** — no gists, no forums, no Discord, no email.

When a task seems to call for it (an issue's premise is wrong, a gap list asks for a number to be
posted, a doc says "post this on #NNNN"), record the finding **locally** — in the repo's docs, a
commit message, or a file — and stop there. Do not offer posting upstream as an option, and do not
ask for permission to; the answer is already no. Issue numbers in this tree are references for
tracking work locally, never destinations.


Guidance for anyone (human or AI agent) submitting a pull request. This is the high-signal map;
[`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) is the full guide (BLE safety contract, design-system
rules, add-a-metric/screen/command recipes), [`docs/BUILD.md`](docs/BUILD.md) covers signing/pairing,
and [`docs/IOS.md`](docs/IOS.md) covers the iOS target. Read this first; follow the links for depth.

**Hardware on hand:** the maintainer's own strap is a **WHOOP 5.0**, so that is the device any
"can you check / try this" is run against, and the family to assume when a report or question does
not name one. Anything 4.0-specific (e.g. the sparse 4.0 motion buffer behind #345) cannot be
verified here without a borrowed strap — say so rather than claiming it was tested.

## What NOOP is (and the hard scope limits)

NOOP is a **fully offline, on-device** companion app for WHOOP 4.0 and 5.0/MG straps (with
**experimental** Oura support in the tree — gated behind `ExperimentalBrand`, not a shipped supported
strap). It pairs over Bluetooth, stores everything in on-device SQLite, and computes recovery / strain
/ HRV / sleep locally. There is **no server, no account, no cloud sync, no telemetry**, and the project stays
**anonymous** (iOS/Android ship build-from-source / sideload, not via the App Store).

These are hard constraints, not preferences. A PR is out of scope if it:
- adds a server, account, cloud sync, or sends any data off-device;
- adds analytics/telemetry/crash-reporting that phones home;
- adds WHOOP firmware, decompiled app code, logos/assets, or any DRM circumvention. NOOP is
  **clean-room interoperability** with hardware the user owns — keep it that way. (That bars
  *implementations* and literals, not every fact learned from one: a protocol offset may be
  re-derived with attribution as an unvalidated candidate — see the "facts vs code" bullet in
  [`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) before telling a contributor no.)

## Architecture at a glance

Core logic lives in **cross-platform Swift packages**; each platform is a thin app layer over them.
The **macOS app is the reference implementation**; **Android is a full shipped app**; **iOS is a
build-from-source target** folded into the same repo.

| Layer | Path | What lives here |
|---|---|---|
| Protocol (pure) | `Packages/WhoopProtocol`, `Packages/OuraProtocol` | BLE frame parse, CRC, command/event/packet decode. **No CoreBluetooth.** Builds on Linux; also builds the `whoop-decode` CLI. |
| Storage | `Packages/WhoopStore` | GRDB/SQLite persistence: migrations, streams, caches. |
| Analytics (pure) | `Packages/StrandAnalytics` | HRV / recovery / strain / sleep / correlation math. Database-free. |
| Import | `Packages/StrandImport` | WHOOP CSV + Apple Health importers. |
| Design system | `Packages/StrandDesign` | SwiftUI palette / components / charts. |
| macOS + shared app | `Strand/` (scheme **Strand**, product `NOOP`, macOS 13+) | `BLE/` (CoreBluetooth), `Collect/`, `Data/` (Repository), `Screens/`, `App/` (`RootView`/`ContentView` = sidebar shell). Shared with iOS where a file isn't macOS-only. |
| iOS-only app | `StrandiOS/` (scheme **NOOPiOS**, iOS 17+), `StrandiOSShared/`, `StrandiOSWidgets/`, `NOOPWatch*` | `StrandiOSApp` (@main), `RootTabView` (the iOS tab shell — no macOS analogue), iOS widgets, watch app. |
| Android app | `android/` (Kotlin, Compose, Room; flavors `Full`/`Demo`) | `com.noop.{ble,collect,data,ingest,analytics,protocol,ui,widget,…}` — mirrors the Swift layering with its own reimplementations. |

`project.yml` is the **XcodeGen source of truth**; `Strand.xcodeproj/` is generated — never hand-edit
or commit it. Re-run `xcodegen generate` after adding/removing files or editing `project.yml`.

**Where new code goes:** the more "wire-level" (bytes) or "math-level" a change is, the deeper into
`Packages/` it belongs — and the more it must be covered by a `swift test` that runs with no app, no
strap, no CoreBluetooth. Never add `import AppKit` / `import UIKit` / `import CoreBluetooth` under
`Packages/`; guard framework code with `#if canImport(AppKit)` / `#elseif canImport(UIKit)`.

## The cross-platform parity contract (the #1 rule)

Android is an independent reimplementation of the same logic, **not** a port that shares code with
Swift. So:

- **Analytics and stored data must be byte-identical across Swift and Kotlin.** If you change a
  decoder, an analytics formula, a migration, or a stored value on one platform, change the twin on
  the other in the same PR (or explicitly call out why not). "It's Compose vs SwiftUI" is *not* a
  license to let the numbers diverge.
- **UI parity is feature-level, not pixel-level.** SwiftUI Charts vs Compose Canvas legitimately
  differ; the *behavior* and the *data* must not.
- **Cross-platform hashes/dedup keys must use a platform-neutral algorithm** (e.g. FNV-1a over UTF-16
  code units) — never `hashValue` (Swift randomizes it) or Kotlin `hashCode` if the value crosses the
  `.noopbak` boundary.
- **The `.noopbak` backup whitelist is a byte-identical contract.** `BackupSettings.swift`
  (`Packages/WhoopStore`) and `BackupSettingsCodec` (`android/…/data/BackupSettings.kt`) must carry
  the same canonical keys + JSON kinds. Only Int/Double/String cross the wire — no dates/objects.
- **Room (Android) and GRDB (iOS) migrations must agree** on the resulting schema. Column order in a
  Room `CREATE TABLE` must match the entity field order; pin migrations with tests.

## Build, test & CI — and what actually validates your change

**This is the part people get wrong.** Know exactly what covers your change before you claim it works.

### Prerequisites (toolchain & packages)
Versions are pinned by the repo — install these before the loops below:
- **JDK 17** — Android + Gradle (`sourceCompatibility`/`jvmTarget` are 17 in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`).
  Gradle **8.7** is provisioned by `android/gradlew`; don't install a system Gradle.
- **Android SDK** — `platform-tools`, `platforms;android-34`, `build-tools;34.0.0` (match `compileSdk` /
  build-tools in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`). Point Gradle at it via `android/local.properties`
  (`sdk.dir=…`, gitignored) or `$ANDROID_HOME`.
- **Swift toolchain ≥ 5.9** — the pure packages declare `swift-tools-version: 5.9`; a 6.x toolchain builds
  them. On **macOS** this ships with Xcode (also required for the app targets); on **Linux** use a
  swift.org toolchain.
- **Linux system packages** (a swift.org toolchain tarball does not bundle its build/runtime deps):
  `build-essential libc6-dev` — the C runtime / crt objects the linker needs; without them `swift build`
  fails at link with `cannot find Scrt1.o … -lc`. Plus `libncurses-dev libxml2 libcurl4 zlib1g-dev
  libedit2 pkg-config unzip`.
- **Android build-tools on non-x86-64 Linux (e.g. arm64):** Google ships `aapt2` / `d8` as **x86-64 only**,
  so resource processing dies with `aapt2 … Syntax error` / `Exec format error` on an arm64 host unless x86
  emulation is present — install `qemu-user-static binfmt-support` and the kernel runs them transparently.
  macOS and x86-64 Linux are unaffected.

### Fast local loops
```bash
# Swift packages (fastest; no Xcode, no strap):
cd Packages/WhoopProtocol && swift build && swift test     # also OuraProtocol
# Android JVM unit tests (run on Linux/macOS, no device):
cd android && ./gradlew testFullDebugUnitTest              # add --tests "com.noop.…" to filter
cd android && ./gradlew compileFullDebugKotlin             # compile the whole app module
# macOS app (needs Xcode on macOS):
xcodegen generate && xcodebuild -project Strand.xcodeproj -scheme Strand \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

### What each CI job covers — and the gaps
| Workflow | Covers | Runner | Default state |
|---|---|---|---|
| `swift-packages.yml` | `swift test` for **`Packages/**` only** (WhoopProtocol, WhoopStore, StrandAnalytics, StrandImport, StrandDesign, NoopLocalAccess) | macos-15 | **active** |
| `app-build.yml` | **Compile-only** of the **app targets** (`Strand` macOS + `NOOPiOS` iOS). iOS leg needs **macos-26** (iOS 26 SDK / `glassEffect`). | macos-15 / macos-26 | **disabled** (on-demand) |
| `android.yml` | `assembleFullDebug` + `testFullDebugUnitTest` | ubuntu | **disabled** (compile Android locally) |
| `fork-testing-build.yml` / `fork-release.yml` | Staging / release builds (apk + mac + ios) | — | on dispatch |

**The trap:** `swift-packages` does **NOT** compile the app targets. So if you touch **app-target
Swift** — anything under `Strand/`, `StrandiOS/`, `StrandiOSShared/`, `StrandiOSWidgets/` (Views,
`AppModel`, `BLEManager`, `Repository`, `RootTabView`, widget publish, …) — **no default CI validates
it**, because `app-build.yml` is disabled. A compile error there (e.g. `'self' used before all stored
properties are initialized`) will pass every green check and still be broken. If you change app-target
Swift, you MUST build the app yourself: `xcodebuild … build` locally, or run `app-build.yml` on demand.

### Local walls (things that will *not* build where you expect)
- **On Linux:** only `WhoopProtocol` / `OuraProtocol` (pure) build & test. Every GRDB-linked package —
  `WhoopStore`, `StrandImport`, `StrandAnalytics` (via `WhoopStore`), and `NoopLocalAccess` — fails with
  `sqlite3.h not found` (GRDB's CSQLite), and `StrandDesign` needs SwiftUI — all need **macOS**. Android
  JVM unit tests **do** run on Linux.
- **App targets** (`Strand`, `NOOPiOS`) need **Xcode on macOS**; there is no Linux/CI unit-test target
  for them (`StrandTests` runs only under `xcodebuild … test` on macOS).
- **BLE behavior cannot be CI- or Linux-tested.** Anything on the CoreBluetooth / offload / live-HR
  path (`Strand/BLE`, `Strand/Collect`, Android `com.noop.ble`) must be **validated on a real strap**;
  compile-success proves nothing about connection behavior. Say what you tested on hardware.

## Hard rules before you touch these areas

- **BLE (read [`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) §BLE safety contract first):** never add
  destructive/write commands to hardware; CRC-gate every inbound frame; keep the connection path
  stable; no hardcoded hex frame bytes in app code — protocol facts live in the decoders/schema.
- **Device / strap model resolution:** map a registry `model` label to a family through the ONE
  canonical resolver (`DeviceFamily.forRegistryModel` on both platforms), never a scattered
  string compare — the wizard stores `"4.0"`, other paths `"WHOOP 4.0"`, and single-spelling checks
  silently miss straps. Reads must thread the registry's **active** strap id, not a raw BLE address.
- **Design system is law:** UI uses only design tokens — `StrandPalette` / `StrandFont` / shared
  components on Apple, `Palette` / `Metrics` on Android. No hardcoded colors, fonts, or spacing.
- **Migrations:** add a versioned migration + a test; never mutate an existing migration. Watch for
  data-loss traps (window-wide deletes, backfill rewrites) — prefer additive/transactional changes.
- **Deriving a physiological signal from raw sensor data — validate against the artifact, not one
  match:** the WHOOP optical/motion buffers are fixed-N-samples-per-record, so autocorrelation/spectral
  methods can manufacture a peak at the record period that *looks* physiological and coincidentally
  matches the WHOOP app on a stable night — that's why the PPG→HR estimate (#194) was withdrawn. A
  single "matched WHOOP" night is **not** validation. Prove the method **tracks a varying input**
  (different subjects, or nights where the true value moves; for synthetic tests, recover *multiple*
  injected values, not one). Until it does, land it as **instrumentation** (decode + store + log the
  estimate beside the incumbent) or behind a **default-off Experimental toggle** — never make it the
  default or feed it a downstream gate (recovery, illness) on thin evidence. (WHOOP 4.0 motion is
  separately too sparse to reliably stage sleep or tell in-bed from out-of-bed — see #345.)

## iOS / Android specifics worth knowing

- **iOS is `NOOPiOS`**, not `Strand`. `ContentView`/`RootView` (the macOS sidebar) are excluded from
  iOS; the iOS shell is `RootTabView`. A file shared with macOS (`TodayView`, `Repository`, analytics)
  must keep compiling for **both** — check the `Strand` (macOS) build too when you edit shared files.
- **Android** is Compose + Room, flavors `Full` (real) and `Demo`. Profile/prefs live in
  SharedPreferences; the DB is Room. UI state uses a `mutate {}` recomposition-counter idiom in places.
- iOS/macOS deployment targets: macOS 13.0, iOS 17.0 (see `project.yml`).

## Validating what we ship (`docs/PENDING_VALIDATION.md`)

Some fixes here **cannot be checked when they land** — the strap produces the confirming data hours or
nights later, and some of it only when the body, the phone's connection state, or the firmware happens
to do the thing the code is watching for. That gap is how a fix quietly becomes folklore: carefully
reasoned, tests green, never once observed working. A week later nobody remembers it was owed a check.

- **Shipping something whose correctness rests on data that doesn't exist yet? Add an entry before
  calling the work done.** The file's table lists the required fields; the load-bearing ones are
  `needs` (the data event that must occur), `check` (the exact command), `passes-if` (decided *now*,
  not after seeing the result), and `check-after` (earliest useful date).
- A `SessionStart` hook (`.claude/settings.json` → `Tools/pending-validation.py`) surfaces ripe
  entries at the start of every session. When it does: **ask whether to validate now.** Don't start
  pulling data unprompted, and don't let it displace what the session is for.
- Validated → move the entry to `## Settled` with what was actually observed. Data still absent →
  bump `check-after`. Never delete an entry that was never checked.
- Keep it to **claims awaiting evidence**. It is not a TODO list; ordinary follow-ups go in the
  tracker. Once it fills with wishlist items the session-start reminder becomes wallpaper.
- A missing or malformed `check-after` reads as **ripe**, on purpose — a typo must make noise rather
  than bury an item forever. `Tools/pending-validation.py --list` prints every open entry by hand.

## PR & commit conventions

- **One concern per PR.** Keep a protocol change, a schema migration, and a UI change separate.
- **Show your verification.** BLE → what you tested on hardware. Analytics → the method + a test.
  UI → confirms design tokens only. App-target Swift → that you compiled the app (CI won't).
- **Keep generated artifacts out of git** (`Strand.xcodeproj/`, `build/`, `.build/`, `*.app`,
  DerivedData). Commit `project.yml`, not the generated project. `Package.resolved` is fine.
- **Cross-platform:** if the change applies to both platforms, do both (or say why not).
- **Versioning (SemVer):** bump `MARKETING_VERSION` in `project.yml` **and** `versionName` in
  `android/app/build.gradle.kts` together; build numbers increment independently. The parts are
  counters, not decimals (`2.0.10` follows `2.0.9`).
- **Voice:** docs/comments are neutral, third-person, project-voice. Keep upstream credits intact.
- **Release-note credits use GitHub handles (#736).** In a release's contributor section, credit
  **third-party** work by `@handle`, not by display name — a plain name is invisible to GitHub, so it
  neither notifies the contributor nor links to their profile. A display name may accompany the handle,
  but the handle is what makes the credit real: `Thanks to @tigercraft4 (Sleep/Health refactors),
  @digitalerdude (workout backfill), …`.
  - Credit both **merged PR authors** and the **issue reporters** whose reports drove a fix — a good bug
    report with a strap log is often the harder half.
  - **Only third-party contributors.** The maintainer's own handles (`@ryanbr` / `@Fanboynz`) are left
    out: self-credit adds noise and self-mentions notify nobody.
  - Collect the handles with **`Tools/release-contributors.sh <since-date|since-tag>`**, which lists every
    third-party merged PR and every issue *closed as completed* in the range, plus a ready credit line,
    with the maintainer's own handles and bot accounts filtered out. A tag argument is bounded at that
    tag's exact instant, so the previous release's work is not re-credited. Writing *what* each person
    contributed is still by hand — that's the judgement part; hunting logins is not. Its output is a work
    list to prune, not a finished line: a reporter whose issue is not worth calling out in the notes can
    be left to the closing "everyone who filed the reports behind these fixes". `Tools/release.sh` warns
    when the notes it is about to publish credit no `@handle`.

When in doubt, prefer the smallest change that's correct and covered by a test that runs without a
strap.
