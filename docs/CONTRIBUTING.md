# Contributing to NOOP

NOOP is a standalone, fully **offline** companion app for WHOOP straps (4.0 and 5.0). It pairs
directly with the strap over Bluetooth Low Energy, stores everything on-device in SQLite, imports
WHOOP CSV exports and Apple Health exports, and computes recovery / strain / HRV / sleep locally —
no cloud, no account. This document explains how the repository is laid out, how to
build and test it, the conventions every change is expected to follow, and the safety rules that are
non-negotiable (especially on the Bluetooth path).

## Ground rules

A few principles run through the whole codebase. Internalize them before opening a PR.

1. **Offline by design.** There is no server, no telemetry, no account, no network call. A change
   that phones home — for any reason — does not belong here. Strap data, imports, and computed
   metrics live in a local SQLite database and never leave the device.
2. **Interoperability, not impersonation.** NOOP talks to a strap the user already owns. It does not
   log into a WHOOP account, bypass a paywall, or ship WHOOP's proprietary code/firmware/assets/logos.
   Keep contributions on the right side of that line, and keep all WHOOP references *nominative*
   (used only to name the hardware).
3. **Never destructive on the wire.** The strap is real hardware on the user's wrist. The app only
   ever sends a curated, reversible command set. See
   [The BLE safety contract](#the-ble-safety-contract-read-this-before-touching-bluetooth).
4. **Transparent math.** Analytics are approximations of published methods, documented file by file.
   No black boxes, no claims of clinical accuracy, no reproduction of any proprietary model.
5. **Credit upstream.** The protocol work is built on prior community reverse-engineering —
   `johnmiddleton12/my-whoop` (WHOOP 4.0) and `b-nnett/goose` (WHOOP 5.0). Preserve those credits in
   code comments and in [`../ATTRIBUTION.md`](../ATTRIBUTION.md).

## Contributor roles & the issue/PR workflow

### Community help vs. maintainer decisions

Community members may help triage issues, answer setup questions, test fixes, or point to existing
documentation — that participation is welcome and valuable. Unless explicitly stated by the
repository maintainer, those replies are **community help, not official maintainer decisions**.
Official project decisions, release calls, security ownership, and merge decisions remain with the
maintainer.

### How issues and PRs are handled here

NOOP runs a **lightweight, maintainer-judgment workflow**, not a strict issue-first gate. Concretely,
that means:

- There are no dedicated triage/approval labels (e.g. `needs-triage`, `confirmed-bug`,
  `approved-feature`, `approved-enhancement`, `needs-review`) and no requirement that a PR link a
  pre-approved issue via `Closes`/`Fixes`/`Resolves #N` before work can start.
- Issues and PRs are reviewed and merged at the maintainer's discretion, weighed against the ground
  rules and safety contracts in this document, rather than moved through a formal multi-stage gate.
- A PR opened without a matching issue, or an issue without a triage label, is **not** by itself a
  process violation in this repo. Contributors and any external review or automated check (including
  strict-gate-style audits) should not treat the absence of gate labels as a contribution failure —
  it reflects how this project currently runs, not an oversight.

This is a deliberate choice for a small, anonymous, offline project; it may change as the project
grows, in which case this section and the issue/PR templates will be updated together. Until then,
opening an issue first to coordinate on anything non-trivial (as this guide recommends throughout) is
still the best way to avoid wasted work — it's just not an enforced gate.

## Repository layout

The codebase is split into reusable, cross-platform Swift packages plus a thin platform-specific app
layer. The **macOS app is the reference implementation**; **Android ships as a full app** under
`android/`, and **iOS was folded into `main` in v1.94** and is a **build-from-source-only target**
(`NOOPiOS` / `NOOPiOSWidgets`) — no App Store/TestFlight, to keep the project anonymous (see
[`IOS.md`](IOS.md)). All reuse the same packages where they can.

### Where logic belongs

| If your change is about… | It belongs in… | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Decoding strap bytes, CRC, framing, packet/event types | `Packages/WhoopProtocol` | **Platform-pure — no CoreBluetooth.** Runs in tests/CLI unchanged. |
| Persisting decoded data, migrations, caches, reads | `Packages/WhoopStore` | GRDB/SQLite only. |
| Computing recovery / strain / HRV / sleep / correlations | `Packages/StrandAnalytics` | Pure, database-free analyzers. |
| Parsing WHOOP CSV or Apple Health `export.xml` | `Packages/StrandImport` | Header-name-driven CSV; streaming SAX XML. |
| Colors, fonts, motion, cards, charts | `Packages/StrandDesign` | No external UI deps; bridges AppKit/UIKit. |
| CoreBluetooth, bonding, offload, live state | `Strand/BLE`, `Strand/Collect` | macOS-app layer — wraps the pure packages. |
| A screen, sidebar item, menu-bar UI, automation | `Strand/Screens`, `Strand/App`, `Strand/System` | App layer. |
| Capturing strap frames on Linux for protocol RE | `Tools/linux-capture` | Python/bleak capture → `whoop-decode`; no Mac/CoreBluetooth. See its [README](../Tools/linux-capture/README.md). |

**Rule of thumb:** the more "wire-level" or "math-level" a change is, the deeper into `Packages/` it
should live, and the more it should be covered by a `swift test` suite that runs without an app, a
strap, or CoreBluetooth.

### Cross-platform discipline

Every package declares **both** `.iOS(.v16)` and `.macOS(.v13)` so the protocol, storage, analytics,
import, and design layers compile and run unmodified on iOS once an app target exists. Any
framework-specific code must be guarded:

```swift
#if canImport(AppKit)
let ns = NSColor(self).usingColorSpace(.sRGB) ?? NSColor(self)
// …
#elseif canImport(UIKit)
let ui = UIColor(self)
// …
#endif
```

Do **not** add `import AppKit`/`import UIKit`/`import CoreBluetooth` to any file under `Packages/` —
that is what breaks the cross-platform contract. CoreBluetooth lives only in the macOS app's
`Strand/BLE`.

---

## Build & test

This is a condensed reference; [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) is the full guide (signing, sandbox,
pairing, re-importing into the on-device DB).

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| macOS 13+ | Deployment target is macOS 13.0. |
| Xcode 15+ (Swift 5.9 toolchain) | Provides `xcodebuild` + the macOS SDK. |
| XcodeGen | Generates `Strand.xcodeproj` from `project.yml` (`brew install xcodegen`). |

The packages themselves only need a Swift toolchain — they build and test with plain `swift build` /
`swift test`, no Xcode project required.

### Per-package iteration (fastest loop)

Most contributions live inside one package. Build and test it in isolation — it's far faster than
the whole app and needs no strap:

```bash
cd Packages/WhoopProtocol && swift build && swift test
cd Packages/WhoopStore     && swift build && swift test
cd Packages/StrandAnalytics && swift build && swift test
cd Packages/StrandImport   && swift build && swift test
cd Packages/StrandDesign   && swift build && swift test
```

### Linux (protocol RE)

The pure packages build and test on Linux with the standard Swift toolchain (no Apple frameworks).
`WhoopProtocol` also produces a `whoop-decode` CLI used by the Linux capture workbench:

```bash
cd Packages/WhoopProtocol
swift build && swift test                 # decoder + its tests, on Linux
swift build --product whoop-decode        # the decode CLI → .build/debug/whoop-decode

cd ../../Tools/linux-capture
python3 -m unittest -v                     # framing/reassembly tests (stdlib only, no bleak)
```

Capturing from a real strap on Linux is documented in
[`../Tools/linux-capture/README.md`](../Tools/linux-capture/README.md).

**What will *not* build on Linux.** Only the pure packages (`WhoopProtocol`, `OuraProtocol`,
`PolarProtocol`) build and test there. Every GRDB-linked package — `WhoopStore`, `StrandImport`,
`StrandAnalytics` (via `WhoopStore`) and `NoopLocalAccess` — fails with `sqlite3.h not found` from
GRDB's CSQLite, and `StrandDesign` needs SwiftUI. All of those need **macOS**. Android JVM unit
tests, by contrast, *do* run on Linux.

### macOS app

The Xcode project is **generated**, not committed. `project.yml` is the source of truth; re-run
generation whenever you add/remove source files or edit `project.yml`:

```bash
xcodegen generate

# fast syntax/type check (no signing, no bundle):
xcodebuild -project Strand.xcodeproj -scheme Strand \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build

# full app + integration tests:
xcodebuild -project Strand.xcodeproj -scheme Strand -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```

The scheme is `Strand`; the built product is `NOOP.app` (`project.yml` sets `PRODUCT_NAME: NOOP`,
bundle id `com.noopapp.noop`). The app is **sandboxed** with the Bluetooth and
user-selected-files entitlements and is **ad-hoc signed** — no Apple Developer account needed for a
personal build. See [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) for the signed-bundle recipe and pairing notes.

### Before you push

- `swift test` passes in every package you touched (and the app's `StrandTests` if you touched the
  app layer).
- `xcodegen generate` has been run if you added or removed files, **but do not commit
  `Strand.xcodeproj/`** — it's gitignored and regenerated from `project.yml`.
- No new third-party dependency unless it's discussed first. Today the only ones are **GRDB.swift**
  (SQLite) and **ZIPFoundation** (export unzip), both via SwiftPM.

### What CI gates — and what it deliberately doesn't

NOOP runs a **deliberately lean CI**: fast, no-hardware checks guard the point of merge, while heavier
and hardware-dependent verification runs at release time or on demand. This is a choice for an
anonymous, offline, sideloaded project — not a gap to fill with more gates.

- **On every PR (required):** `swift-packages` runs `swift test` for `Packages/**`; `i18n-coverage`
  runs the string audit. These catch the regressions that matter most (protocol/analytics math,
  storage, i18n) without a device or an Xcode/Gradle app build.
- **Disabled by design — you build the app yourself:** `app-build.yml` (app-target compile, iOS needs
  `macos-26`) and `android.yml` (Android app build) are **off**. So a compile error in **app-target**
  code (SwiftUI Views, `BLEManager`, `Repository`, a Compose screen) passes every default check.
  Before you push app-layer changes, compile locally — `xcodebuild … build` /
  `./gradlew compileFullDebugKotlin` — or dispatch `app-build.yml` on demand.
- **Gated at release, not per PR:** Android release lint (`lintVitalFullRelease`) runs inside
  `assembleFullRelease` in the staging/release builds, so lint-fatal issues (e.g. an
  `ExtraTranslation` in a `values-<lang>` file) surface there. Run `./gradlew lintVitalFullRelease`
  locally before a release if you touched `res/`.
- **On demand:** `app-build.yml` also runs the `StrandTests` macOS integration suite; dispatch it when
  you change app-target Swift that no package test covers.
- **Absent on purpose:** dependency/vuln scanning and Android instrumentation/connected tests. The
  dependency set is small and pinned, there is no server or telemetry, and BLE/offload behavior is
  validated **on a real strap** — compile-success proves nothing about connection behavior.

---

## The design system is the law

`StrandDesign` is the single source of visual truth. **Every screen composes only its tokens and
components.** Do not hardcode colors, sizes, fonts, or invent ad-hoc cards.

### Color — `StrandPalette` only

Never write a raw hex value or a system color in a screen. Pull from
`Packages/StrandDesign/Sources/StrandDesign/Palette.swift`:

```swift
// ✅ correct
.foregroundStyle(StrandPalette.textPrimary)
.background(StrandPalette.surfaceRaised)
let tint = StrandPalette.recoveryColor(score)      // gradient-sampled, 0...100
let strain = StrandPalette.strainColor(value)      // 0...21 scale

// ❌ wrong
.foregroundStyle(Color(hex: "#F4F7F5"))
.background(Color(red: 0.05, green: 0.08, blue: 0.07))
```

The palette is dark-only and instrument-grade. Semantic tokens exist for surfaces
(`surfaceBase`/`surfaceRaised`/`surfaceOverlay`/`surfaceInset`), text
(`textPrimary`/`textSecondary`/`textTertiary`), `hairline`/`hairlineStrong` borders, the `accent`
chrome green, status colors (`statusPositive`/`statusWarning`/`statusCritical`), the recovery and
strain gradients, sleep-stage colors, and HR zones. There are sampling helpers
(`recoveryColor`, `strainColor`, `sleepStageColor`, `hrZoneColor`) — use them rather than picking a
stop by hand. If a screen needs a color that isn't in the palette, the answer is almost always "use
an existing token", and otherwise "add the token to the palette", never "inline a hex".

### Type — `StrandFont` only

From `Typography.swift`. Use the named scale (`title1`, `title2`, `headline`, `body`, `caption`,
`overline`, `mono`, …). **All live/numeric values use tabular digits** so they don't reflow — use
`StrandFont.number(_:)`, `bodyNumber`, `captionNumber`, or `display(_:)`. For ALL-CAPS overline
labels, use the `Text.strandOverline()` helper rather than styling by hand.

### Components — compose, don't reinvent

From `Components.swift` and the chart files. The locked surface is **`NoopCard`** (one radius,
border, fill, and hover behavior). Build screens from the shared pieces:

| Component | Use |
|---|---|
| `NoopCard` | The one card surface. Every card is this. |
| `StatTile` | Uniform fixed-height metric tile (`NoopMetrics.tileHeight`), with optional sparkline + delta. |
| `ChartCard` / `ChartFooter` | Header + fixed-height chart body + optional footer stats. |
| `SectionHeader` | Overline + title + optional trailing. |
| `InsightCard` | Category / status / detail insight block. |
| `SegmentedPillControl` | The one range/segmented control (used everywhere). |
| `SourceBadge` | "MY-WHOOP" / "APPLE HEALTH" provenance chip. |
| `RecoveryRing`, `StrainGauge`, `Hypnogram`, `Sparkline`, `TrendChart`, `YearHeatStrip`, `StatePill` | Charts/indicators. |

Spacing and sizing come from `NoopMetrics` (`cardRadius`, `cardPadding`, `gap`, `sectionGap`,
`screenPadding`, `tileHeight`, `chartHeight`) and animation from `StrandMotion`
(`interactive`, `gentle`, `hero`, …). Do not introduce magic numbers for these.

**If you find yourself writing a one-off card, gradient, font size, or animation in a screen, stop**
— either it already exists in `StrandDesign`, or it should be added there (with a `#Preview`) and
then used. Screens stay thin; the system stays canonical.

---

## Coding conventions

- **Swift, four-space indent, no trailing whitespace.** Match the surrounding file.
- **Public API is intentional.** `public` only what a consumer package or the app actually needs.
  Internal helpers stay internal. Types crossing concurrency boundaries are `Sendable` where it makes
  sense (e.g. `DeviceFamily`, `AnalyticsEngine.ProfileBaselines`).
- **Resolve a strap model through the one canonical resolver.** Map a registry `model` label to a
  family with `DeviceFamily.forRegistryModel` (it exists on both platforms) — never an ad-hoc string
  compare. The pairing wizard stores `"4.0"` while other paths store `"WHOOP 4.0"`, so a
  single-spelling check silently misses straps. Reads must thread the registry's **active** strap id,
  not a raw BLE address.
- **Document the "why", and cite sources.** Protocol and analytics code carries comments that explain
  *where a fact came from* — e.g. `crc16Modbus` is annotated "Ported verbatim from the Goose
  reverse-engineering"; the safe command list cites the upstream `CommandNumber` table; analyzers
  cite Task Force 1996 (HRV), Karvonen (%HRR), Edwards/Banister (TRIMP), Tanaka (HRmax). Preserve and
  extend these citations; they are how we keep the math transparent and the protocol auditable.
- **Pure where possible.** `WhoopProtocol` decode functions, `StrandAnalytics` analyzers, and
  `FrameRouter` are deliberately free of side effects and frameworks so they're unit-testable. Keep
  new logic in that pure style and let the app layer do the I/O.
- **`@MainActor` for UI-touching state.** `FrameRouter` and live-state types are main-actor isolated;
  `CBCentralManager` is created on `.main` so delegate callbacks land on the main actor. Don't move
  CoreBluetooth work off-main without a very good reason.
- **No anonymous magic.** Reach for an existing constant/enum (`NoopMetrics`, `StrandPalette`,
  `WhoopCommand`, `MetricCatalog`) before introducing a literal.
- **Validate before you trust.** Any data coming off the wire is gated on its checksum *and*
  range-checked before it can drive state (see `FrameRouter.handle` rejecting `crcOK == false` and
  clamping HR to 30…220). New inbound paths follow the same pattern.

---

## The BLE safety contract (read this before touching Bluetooth)

The strap is real hardware on someone's wrist. The Bluetooth path is the highest-stakes code in the
repo, and it has a small number of **hard rules**. A PR that violates any of them will not be merged.

### 1. Never add destructive commands

The app's outbound command set lives in `Strand/BLE/Commands.swift` as `WhoopCommand`. It is
**intentionally a curated subset** of the strap's command space. The file says so explicitly:

```swift
/// Curated, SAFE WHOOP command set for *sending* to the strap.
///
/// This is intentionally a *subset*: DESTRUCTIVE commands that wipe data or brick the strap
/// (firmware load/DFU, force-trim, ship-mode, power-cycle, fuel-gauge reset) stay deliberately
/// EXCLUDED so the in-app command sender can never form those bytes. The ONE exception is
/// `rebootStrap` (a plain, non-destructive restart), sent only from a user-initiated, confirmed action.
```

Every other command in the enum is **safe and reversible** — toggle realtime HR, read clock /
battery / version / data range, run/stop a haptic pattern, arm/read/cancel the firmware alarm,
enter/exit high-frequency sync, start/stop raw data. **Do not add firmware/DFU,
ship-mode/power-cycle, force-trim, fuel-gauge reset, or any command that can brick, wipe, or
permanently alter the device.** The lone reboot exception is deliberate and narrow: a restart keeps
all stored data and NOOP already reboots the strap via rename — it is confirmation-gated and never
sent automatically (#166). If you believe another non-trivial command is genuinely needed, open an
issue first, justify why it's reversible, and document its payload and on-device verification before
any code.

### 2. CRC-gate everything

Frames are only acted on after both CRCs pass. Outbound frames are built with the correct CRCs;
inbound frames are rejected if their checksum fails.

- **Outbound:** `WhoopCommand.frame(seq:payload:)` builds
  `[0xAA][len u16 LE][crc8(len)][type=35][seq][cmd][payload…][crc32 LE]`, computing `crc8` over the
  length bytes and the zlib `crc32` over the inner bytes. The WHOOP 4.0 and 5.0 envelopes differ
  (WHOOP 4 uses a CRC8 header; WHOOP 5 / the "goose" path uses a CRC16-Modbus header) — see
  `Packages/WhoopProtocol/Sources/WhoopProtocol/Framing.swift` (`verifyFrame`, `verifyFrame(_:family:)`).
- **Inbound:** `FrameRouter.handle(frame:)` decodes with `parseFrame` and **rejects any frame whose
  `crcOK == false`** before it can touch `LiveState`. Bad bytes never drive state. New inbound paths
  must do the same.

Never short-circuit a CRC check "to make a capture work". If a real frame fails CRC, the bug is in
the framing/decoding, not in the check.

### 3. Keep the BLE path stable

The connect/bond/offload state machine in `Strand/BLE/BLEManager.swift` (plus `Strand/Collect/`) is
load-bearing and was hardened against real failure modes that are documented in the comments
(racing `SEND_HISTORICAL` ahead of the handshake, straps left parked in high-freq sync, a type-43
realtime-raw flood that dominated flash). Treat it as stable infrastructure:

- **Don't reorder the connect handshake.** Offload is deliberately gated on
  `connectHandshakeDone`; `SET_CLOCK` (cmd 10) must precede arming the firmware alarm so the strap
  RTC is UTC-correct.
- **Don't `ENTER` high-frequency sync.** The app no longer enters it and sends `exitHighFreqSync`
  defensively on connect to release straps parked there by older builds.
- **Prefer `.withoutResponse` writes** (the `send(_:payload:writeType:)` default); use
  `.withResponse` only where an ack is genuinely required (e.g. `historicalDataResult`), matching the
  existing call sites.
- **Verify on real hardware.** Anything that changes what bytes go out, or when, must be tested
  against an actual strap and the result noted in the PR. The existing comments do exactly this
  (e.g. "Verified on-device: 2.1/s → 0/s, and it persists across reconnect").

### 4. Protocol facts live in the decoders, not in app code

**No hardcoded hex frame bytes in the app layer.** A literal frame pasted into `Strand/`,
`StrandiOS/` or `android/…/ui` is a protocol fact that no test covers and no other platform can see.
Opcodes, offsets, and payload shapes belong in the decoders and in
`WhoopProtocol/Resources/whoop_protocol.json`, where both platforms read the same value and the
oracle fixtures pin it. The app calls a named command; it does not spell one.

> The decode core (`WhoopProtocol`) and the router (`FrameRouter`) are pure and unit-tested, so you
> can iterate on parsing and routing logic with `swift test` and captured frames *without* a strap.
> Reserve on-device testing for the connection/command behavior that genuinely needs it.

---

## How to add things safely

### Add a new metric

A "metric" is a named daily/series value that flows from an importer or analyzer into SQLite and out
to the Explore / Compare / tile UI. The catalog is the contract.

1. **Write the series.** An importer (`Packages/StrandImport`) or analyzer
   (`Packages/StrandAnalytics`) produces points; they're persisted via
   `WhoopStore.upsertMetricSeries(_:deviceId:)` into the `metricSeries` table. **The series `key`
   must match exactly** what the catalog expects.
2. **Register it in the catalog.** Add a `MetricDescriptor` row in
   `Strand/Data/MetricCatalog.swift` via the `d(...)` helper:

   ```swift
   d("resp_rate", "Respiratory Rate", "Recovery", "rpm", "my-whoop", "lungs", 1, nil),
   //  key          title                category     unit   source      sf-symbol   decimals  higherIsBetter
   ```

   - `key` — the exact `metricSeries` key the importer/analyzer writes.
   - `category` — one of `MetricCatalog.categories` (`Heart`, `Recovery`, `Sleep`, `Strain`,
     `Health`); add a new category only if it's genuinely needed.
   - `source` — `"my-whoop"` (strap/CSV) or `"apple-health"`; drives the `SourceBadge`.
   - `higherIsBetter` — `true`/`false`/`nil`; controls delta tinting. Use `nil` when "better" is
     ambiguous (e.g. respiratory rate).

3. **That's it for the UI.** Metric Explorer and Compare are *built from the catalog*, so a correctly
   registered metric with data behind it appears automatically. No screen edits required.
4. **Add a test.** If a new importer/analyzer produces the series, cover the parse/compute in that
   package's test suite.

> **Verify the key in three places** before you push: what the importer/analyzer *writes*, the
> `MetricCatalog` `key`, and any SQL `WHERE key = …`. Mismatched keys are a known class of bug here —
> a metric that silently shows no data is almost always a key typo.

### Add a new screen

1. **Build it from `StrandDesign`.** Compose `NoopCard`, `StatTile`, `ChartCard`, `SectionHeader`,
   etc.; pull every color/font/size from `StrandPalette` / `StrandFont` / `NoopMetrics`. Use the
   shared `ScreenScaffold` for the standard screen chrome (see existing screens in `Strand/Screens`).
2. **Register it in the sidebar.** `Strand/App/RootView.swift` drives navigation from the `NavItem`
   enum:
   - add a `case` to `NavItem` (its `rawValue` is the sidebar label),
   - add an SF Symbol in the `icon` switch,
   - add the `case` to the `detail` view-builder switch that maps `NavItem` → your `View`.
3. **Keep state where it belongs.** Read through `AppModel` / `Repository`; don't reach into
   CoreBluetooth or SQLite directly from a view.
4. **Optional features default OFF.** Anything that takes a Mac action, fires a notification, or
   automates behavior is opt-in and toggleable, matching the existing Automations/Notifications

### Add a new BLE command

Only after re-reading [The BLE safety contract](#the-ble-safety-contract-read-this-before-touching-bluetooth).

1. **Confirm it is safe and reversible.** If it can brick, wipe, reflash, ship-mode, or permanently
   alter the strap, it does not go in. No exceptions.
2. **Add the case to `WhoopCommand`** in `Strand/BLE/Commands.swift` with its on-wire raw value, a
   `label`, and a comment documenting the payload, what it does, why it's safe/reversible, and how it
   was verified on-device.
3. **Add a payload builder if needed** (cf. `setAlarmPayload(epochSec:)`), keeping the byte layout
   documented.
4. **Send it through the existing path** — `BLEManager.send(_:payload:writeType:)` — which frames the
   command (correct CRC8 + CRC32) and writes to the command characteristic. Don't build raw writes
   by hand.
5. **Verify on a real strap** and record the result in the PR.

### Add a database column or table

Schema lives in `Packages/WhoopStore/Sources/WhoopStore/Database.swift` as a **versioned GRDB
`DatabaseMigrator`** (currently through `v9`).

- **Never edit an existing migration.** They've already run on users' on-device databases. Add a
  **new** `migrator.registerMigration("vN") { db in … }` block.
- The early migrations create the durable decoded-stream tables (`hrSample`, `rrInterval`,
  `spo2Sample`, `skinTempSample`, `respSample`, the raw outbox) keyed by `(deviceId, ts)`; later ones
  add metric caches (`sleepSession`, `dailyMetric`, `metricSeries`), cursors, and more. Follow the
  same shape and naming.
- Add a `MigrationTests` case proving the migration applies cleanly on top of the prior version.
- **Watch for data-loss traps.** Window-wide deletes and backfill rewrites can discard rows a user
  can never recover — the strap does not keep a second copy. Prefer additive and transactional
  changes; if a migration must remove or rewrite data, say so in the commit message and prove the
  bound with a test.
- **Update `schema_oracle.json` in the same PR.** Room (Android) and GRDB (iOS) must agree on the
  resulting schema, and that agreement is pinned by a shared fixture committed in two byte-identical
  copies (`Packages/WhoopStore/Tests/WhoopStoreTests/Resources/` and `android/app/src/test/resources/`).
  `SchemaOracleTests.swift` compares it to GRDB's `PRAGMA table_info`; `SchemaOracleTest.kt` compares it
  to the schema Room's KSP processor exports. Both fail on a column added to one side only, a column
  ORDER difference, a type/nullability/DEFAULT change, a primary-key change, an index change, or a new
  unpinned table — so a migration cannot land until the twin lands with it. A divergence that is
  deliberate must be written into the fixture's `divergenceReasons` with the reason and what closing it
  would cost; the suites also fail on a ledger entry that has stopped being true, so the list can only
  shrink on purpose. Extend the oracle rather than adding a parallel mechanism (same idiom as
  `decoder_oracle.json`).
- **GRDB migration identifiers are `v<N>[-slug]`, strictly sequential.** GRDB keys migrations by NAME
  and applies them in registration order, so two open PRs that both add a `v31` produce two migrations
  claiming one number (and an exact name collision makes GRDB silently skip the second body). The
  oracle test asserts the numbers run 1…N with no gaps or repeats: renumber when you rebase.

### Derive a physiological signal from raw sensor data

**Validate against the artifact, not against one match.** The WHOOP optical and motion buffers are
fixed-N-samples-per-record, so autocorrelation and spectral methods can manufacture a peak at the
*record period* that looks physiological and coincidentally matches the WHOOP app on a stable night.
That is why the PPG→HR estimate (#194) was withdrawn after it appeared to work.

A single "matched WHOOP" night is **not** validation. Prove the method **tracks a varying input** —
different subjects, or nights where the true value actually moves; for synthetic tests, recover
*multiple* injected values, not one.

Until it does, land the work as **instrumentation** (decode, store, and log the estimate beside the
incumbent) or behind a **default-off Experimental toggle**. Never make it the default, and never let
it feed a downstream gate such as recovery or illness detection, on thin evidence. This is the same
boundary [`SCOPE.md`](SCOPE.md) draws for local rhythm instrumentation.

WHOOP 4.0 motion is separately too sparse to reliably stage sleep or distinguish in-bed from
out-of-bed — see #345 before building on it.

## Tests & fixtures

- **Each package owns its tests** under `Packages/<Name>/Tests/…`; run them with `swift test`.
  Coverage already includes framing/CRC parity, reassembly, schema, stream decode, store
  insert/read/migration/prune, the analyzers (HRV, recovery, strain, sleep, correlation, baselines,
  workout detection), and the CSV / Apple Health importers (including real-export tests).
- **`Fixtures/`** holds a sample WHOOP export for the import tests; `StrandImport` test resources are
  bundled via the package's `Package.swift`.
- **Prefer pure tests.** Because `WhoopProtocol`, `StrandAnalytics`, and `FrameRouter` are
  framework-free, you can (and should) cover new decode/routing/math with captured frames and
  fixtures rather than requiring a strap.
- **`StrandTests`** is the macOS-app integration suite (run via `xcodebuild … test`).

---

## Commit & PR conventions

- **Generated artifacts stay out of git.** `Strand.xcodeproj/`, `build/`, `.build/`, `*.app`, and
  DerivedData are gitignored; commit `project.yml`, not the generated project. `Package.resolved` is
  fine to commit.
- **One concern per PR.** Keep a protocol change, a schema migration, and a UI change in separate
  commits/PRs where practical.
- **Show your verification.** For anything on the BLE path, state what you tested on real hardware.
  For analytics, cite the method and add a test. For UI, confirm it uses only `StrandDesign` tokens.
- **Anonymous, project-voice.** Documentation and comments are written in a neutral, third-person
  project voice. Keep upstream credits (`my-whoop`, `goose`, `GRDB.swift`, `ZIPFoundation`) intact.
- **No proprietary material.** Don't add WHOOP firmware, decompiled app code, logos, or assets, and
  don't introduce DRM circumvention. Keep contributions to clean-room interoperability with hardware
  the user owns.
- **Facts vs code — the line that actually gets tested.** The rule above is about *code*: verbatim or
  transcribed implementations, string literals, and assets stay out however correct they are. A
  **protocol fact** — a byte offset, a field width, an enum value — is an observation about the wire,
  and this project's practice is that it may be reimplemented, *provided* it is attributed and lands as an **unvalidated candidate**: decoded and
  logged, never backing a shipped metric, until independent captures clear it. `spo2_candidate_82`
  (v18 byte `@82`) is the worked example — sourced from a decompile, attributed as such in
  `Interpreter.swift`, gated by a test that stops it ever writing `spo2Pct`, and still a candidate
  because the cross-device evidence is split. See [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](../ATTRIBUTION.md).

  This matters because third-party WHOOP projects are frequently decompile-derived. "It came from a
  decompile" doesn't by itself rule a finding out; **copying their implementation does**, and so does
  shipping a metric on an unvalidated one.
- **Licensing.** By opening a pull request you agree your contribution is licensed under the same
  [PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0](../LICENSE) as the rest of NOOP. Forks and personal,
  non-commercial use are welcome under those terms.

## Versioning

NOOP follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) — `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **PATCH** (e.g. `2.0.1`) — bug fixes, diagnostics, small tweaks.
- **MINOR** (e.g. `2.1.0`) — a new, backwards-compatible feature.
- **MAJOR** (e.g. `3.0.0`) — a milestone, redesign, or a change that breaks an existing setup or data.

The three parts are independent counters, **not** decimals: `2.0.10` follows `2.0.9`, and there's no
"next number after `1.99`" — a new feature line is `2.1.0`, not `1.100`. The marketing version lives
in `project.yml` (`MARKETING_VERSION`) and `android/app/build.gradle.kts` (`versionName`); the build
numbers (`CFBundleVersion` / `versionCode`) increment independently on every release.

### Release-note credits use GitHub handles (#736)

In a release's contributor section, credit **third-party** work by `@handle`, not by display name. A
plain name is invisible to GitHub — it neither notifies the contributor nor links to their profile. A
display name may accompany the handle, but the handle is what makes the credit real:
`Thanks to @tigercraft4 (Sleep/Health refactors), @digitalerdude (workout backfill), …`.

- Credit both **merged PR authors** and the **issue reporters** whose reports drove a fix. A good bug
  report with a strap log is often the harder half.
- **Only third-party contributors.** The maintainer's own handles are left out: self-credit adds
  noise and self-mentions notify nobody.
- Collect the handles with **`Tools/release-contributors.sh <since-date|since-tag>`**, which lists
  every third-party merged PR and every issue *closed as completed* in the range, plus a ready credit
  line, with maintainer handles and bot accounts filtered out. A tag argument is bounded at that tag's
  exact instant, so the previous release's work is not re-credited. Writing *what* each person
  contributed is still by hand — that's the judgement part; hunting logins is not. Its output is a
  work list to prune, not a finished line: a reporter whose issue is not worth calling out can be left
  to the closing "everyone who filed the reports behind these fixes". `Tools/release.sh` warns when
  the notes it is about to publish credit no `@handle`.

## Roadmap

NOOP's logic already lives in cross-platform packages, so most platform work is app-layer wiring
rather than rewrites of the core. Today the **macOS app is the working reference implementation**
and **Android ships as a full app**; the items below are planned, experimental, or deferred.
Contributions toward these are welcome — open an issue to coordinate first.

### Other platforms

- **Windows app (planned).** A native desktop client for Windows. The protocol facts in
  `WhoopProtocol/Resources/whoop_protocol.json` and the framing/CRC rules are language-agnostic, so
  the wire behavior is portable; the work is a Windows BLE stack + UI re-implementation that matches
  the shared packages' behavior.
- **Android (shipped).** A full, native Kotlin/Gradle client lives under `android/`, re-implementing
  the same wire protocol against Android's BLE stack — it pairs, offloads, persists and scores
  on-device, and imports WHOOP / Apple Health / Health Connect. Pre-built APKs are in
  [Releases](https://github.com/ryanbr/noop/releases). Continued real-hardware testing across more devices is always welcome
  (an emulator can't reach a physical strap).
- **iOS (build-from-source target on `main`).** iOS was folded into `main` in v1.94 as a first-class
  build-from-source target — the `NOOPiOS` and `NOOPiOSWidgets` schemes (app target plus widgets, a
  Live Activity, and HealthKit), built against current code in Xcode, with CI compiling both macOS and
  iOS on every change. It is **build-it-yourself only, intentionally not shipped:** iOS has no
  anonymous distribution path (the App Store and TestFlight both require a real Apple Developer
  identity), which is at odds with NOOP staying anonymous, so there are no pre-built downloads. Every
  package declares `.iOS(.v16)` and guards UI-framework code with `#if canImport(UIKit)/AppKit`, so
  the shared core and analytics run unmodified — results match macOS. It is newer and less
  battle-tested than macOS/Android (live BLE on a real iPhone isn't fully validated yet), so
  on-hardware testing is especially welcome; [`IOS.md`](IOS.md) is the detailed guide.

### Deferred ideas

These are scoped but intentionally not built yet. They're listed so contributors know the direction
(and the open questions) before investing time:

- **Live PPG scope.** Surface the strap's raw optical (PPG) stream as a live waveform/diagnostic
  view. The raw-data plumbing exists (`startRawData`/`stopRawData`, the type-43 realtime-raw control,
  `enableOpticalData`), but a stable, useful live scope is deferred.
- **Steps via IMU.** Derive step count on-device from the strap's accelerometer/IMU
  (`toggleIMUMode`) instead of relying on the imported Apple Health `steps` series.
- **Notification-watcher helper.** A small, opt-in helper to mirror selected macOS notifications to a
  haptic cue on the strap. Strictly local, off by default, and bounded — no general-purpose
  notification scraping.

> Roadmap items don't change the ground rules. Everything above still holds: offline-only, no
> destructive BLE commands, CRC-gated, design-system-only UI, transparent and clearly-non-clinical
> math, and credit to the upstream reverse-engineering work.
